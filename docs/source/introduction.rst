About Avantis
-------------

`Avantis <https://avantisfi.com/>`_ is at the forefront of decentralized leveraged trading platforms, offering users the ability to take long or short positions in synthetic crypto, forex, and commodities using perpetualsâ€”a financial instrument that provides leverage without an expiration date. With synthetic leverage and a USDC stablecoin liquidity pool, Avantis achieves high capital efficiency, enabling a diverse selection of tradable assets and leverage up to 100x.

The platform also introduces fine-grained risk management for liquidity providers (LPs) through time and risk parameters. This innovation allows any LP to become a sophisticated market maker for a wide range of derivatives, starting with perpetuals.
